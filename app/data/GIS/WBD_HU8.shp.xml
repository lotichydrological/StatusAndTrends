The watershed and subwatershed hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. These smaller sized hydrologic units (up to 250,000 acres) are useful in many programs supported by the NRCS and others.</supplinf><langdata Sync="TRUE">en</langdata></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>unknown</caldate><time>unknown</time></sngdate></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Unknown</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>

A number of new Hydrological Unit Boundaries were also delineated using flow lines and basins computed from 10- and 30-meter horizontal resolution Digital Elevation data based on flow derived from the elevation grid to determine potential pour points. This workshop process resulted in a seamless hydrologic boundary dataset for Oregon.  

The PNWHF dataset was made available via its website for operational edits.  PNWHF Partners downloaded the dataset, edited boundaries and attribution, and submitted the updated dataset back to the PNWHF server.

The Oregon WBD dataset was updated to incorporate changes submitted by Pacific Northwest Hydrography Framework (PNWHF) partner organizations.  The changes included small boundary adjustments that result in a better match with NHD, an updated 12 digit HU boundary derived from LiDAR source data, and WBD HU name changes.  Each of these proposed changes were reviewed by affected stewards for validity. 
The WBD boundary was changed in areas where the NHD was crossing the WBD boundary. In these instances, the NHD source was the PNWHF dataset and not the DRG.  Subwatershed 171002030602 was completely replaced using Oregon Department of Forestry's (ODF)  boundaries that were derived from LiDAR source data.  This LiDAR based DEM highlighted several areas where the WBD did not accurately reflect the condition on the ground. In several locations the old WBD boundary crossed stream channels indicated on the DEM. ODF used a 5 foot contour layer, derived from the LiDAR DEM, to delineate the boundary changes. Updates to the WBD boundaries for this subwatershed were performed using the ESRI Reshape Featuretool.  This update affected six adjoining 12 digit HU all within the same 10 digit HU.
Name changes were submitted at the 10 and 12 digit HU level. The attributes HU_10_NAME and HU_12_NAME were updated depending on the change request.
USGS at this time made updates to WBD boundary adding Water HU's for the Oregon coast.</procdesc><procdate>20100713</procdate><proccont><cntinfo><cntperp><cntper>Bryant Mecklem</cntper><cntorg>BLM OSO</cntorg></cntperp><cntpos>GIS Specialist</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>P.O.

The Oregon WBD dataset was updated to incorporate changes submitted by Pacific Northwest Hydrography Framework (PNWHF) partner organizations.  The changes include updated 12 digit HU boundaries derived from LiDAR source data.  Each of these proposed changes were reviewed by affected stewards for validity. 
Subwatersheds 171002030601, 171002030602, and 171003080106 were delineated using 10 foot, and 3 foot contour layers that were derived from a LiDAR DEM.  This LiDAR based DEM highlighted several areas where the WBD did not accurately reflect the condition on the ground.  In most instances the boundary just needed to be moved to the ridge tops. This did not affect the overall size or the outlet of the subwatershed.  However, in subwatershed 171003080106 the LiDAR source data did highlight that the outlet needed to be changed. This change affected two adjacent subwatersheds 171003080105 and 171003080107.  The changes to the outlets were reviewed and accepted by the state stewards. In all but 171002030601, the adjoining subwatersheds were affected by this update.  Subwateshed 71002030601 was updated in the last Oregon submittal and not all of the adjoining subwatershed's arcs needed to be updated.

The WBD_Oregon coverage contains attributes for polygons and arcs. Hydrologic Unit delineations are closed polygons that encompass all area draining toward the lowest point (called pour point) in the polygon. Because of nominal sizes for the different hydrologic unit level: Watershed (40,000 to 250,000 acres) and Subwatershed (generally 10,000 to 40,000 acres), some polygons do not include all areas up to the drainage divide but all areas to one or more other upstream hydrologic units. A unique hydrologic unit code is used to identify each hydrologic unit. The hydrologic unit codes start with the 8-digit Sub-basin (huc_8) number that contains the Watershed. Likewise the Subwatershed hydrologic unit codes (huc_12) start with the 10-digit Watershed number (huc_10) that contains the Subwatershed.   Attributes associated with a hydrologic unit code includes: ACRES, HUC_10_TYPE, HUC_12_TYPE, HUC_10_MOD, HUC_12_MOD, , HU_8_NAME, HU_10_NAME, HU_12_NAME,  STATES, NCONTRB_A, HU_10_DS, HU_12_DS, HUC_MOD, COMMENT, HUC_8, HUC_10, HUC_12, HU_10_GNIS_NUM, HU_12_GNIS_NUM, HUC_LEVEL, LINESOURCE, LINEVER, LINEDATE, LINEORG, META_ID, COMMENT.</eaover></overview></eainfo><distinfo><distrib><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Bureau of Land Management</cntorg><cntper>Eric Hiebenthal</cntper></cntorgp><cntaddr><addrtype>Mailing address</addrtype><address>P.O Box 2965</address><city>Portland</city><state>OR</state><postal>97208</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>503-808-6340</cntvoice><cntfax>503-808-6419</cntfax><cntemail>ehiebent@blm.gov</cntemail><cntpos>GIS Data Management Specialist</cntpos><cntinst>contact instructions</cntinst></cntinfo></distrib><distliab>

The PNWHF Partnership initiated a workshop-oriented process whereby agreed-upon hydrologic boundaries were accepted or delineated using 1:24,000 scale Digital Raster Graphics. A number of new Hydrological Unit Boundaries were also delineated using flow lines and basins computed from 10- and 30-meter horizontal resolution Digital Elevation data based on flow derived from the elevation grid to determine potential pour points. This workshop process resulted in a seamless hydrologic boundary dataset for Oregon. The PNWHF dataset was made available via its website for operational edits. PNWHF Partners downloaded the dataset, edited boundaries and attribution, and submitted the updated dataset back to the PNWHF server. The dataset was frozen prior to submittal to the review and edit process, the precursor to NRCS certification.</stepDesc><stepDateTm>2002-01-01</stepDateTm><stepSrc type="used"><srcCitatn><resAltTitle>DEM30</resAltTitle></srcCitatn></stepSrc><stepSrc type="used"><srcCitatn><resAltTitle>DRG</resAltTitle></srcCitatn></stepSrc></prcStep><prcStep><stepDesc>USGS refined the PNWHF Hydrologic Unit Boundaries and required attribution using consistent, reproducible methods that meet the "Federal Standards for Delineations of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries". It was agreed that the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) would be the primary source used for delineating boundaries. Arc, polygon and attribute adjustments were made to each PNW#. Changes were limited in the dataset to only those modifications that were needed to meet the national guidelines. Replacement of boundary lines or HU names that already meet the standard were to be avoided. There were two reviews by PNW Hydrography Framework (PNWHF) before a final was delivered back to PNWHF by USGS. After each review USGS incorporated changes that were identified and agreed-upon during the review process.</stepDesc><stepDateTm>2006-01-01</stepDateTm><stepProc><rpIndName>Kimberly Jones</rpIndName><rpOrgName>USGS</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress><eMailAdd>kjones@usgs.gov</eMailAdd></cntAddress></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="009"/></role></stepProc></prcStep><prcStep><stepDesc>META_ID: OR04 NHDPlus updates and OR05 Canadian border updates and Ocean updates.

The changes included small boundary adjustments that result in a better match with NHD, an updated 12 digit HU boundary derived from LiDAR source data, and WBD HU name changes. Each of these proposed changes were reviewed by affected stewards for validity. The WBD boundary was changed in areas where the NHD was crossing the WBD boundary. In these instances, the NHD source was the PNWHF dataset and not the DRG. Subwatershed 171002030602 was completely replaced using Oregon Department of Forestry's (ODF) boundaries that were derived from LiDAR source data. This LiDAR based DEM highlighted several areas where the WBD did not accurately reflect the condition on the ground. In several locations the old WBD boundary crossed stream channels indicated on the DEM. ODF used a 5 foot contour layer, derived from the LiDAR DEM, to delineate the boundary changes. Updates to the WBD boundaries for this subwatershed were performed using the ESRI Reshape Featuretool. This update affected six adjoining 12 digit HU all within the same 10 digit HU. Name changes were submitted at the 10 and 12 digit HU level. The attributes HU_10_NAME and HU_12_NAME were updated depending on the change request. USGS at this time made updates to WBD boundary adding Water HU's for the Oregon coast.</stepDesc><stepDateTm>2010-07-13</stepDateTm><stepProc><rpIndName>Bryant Mecklem</rpIndName><rpOrgName>BLM OSO</rpOrgName><rpPosName>GIS Specialist</rpPosName><rpCntInfo><cntPhone><voiceNum>(503) 808-6506</voiceNum></cntPhone><cntAddress addressType="postal"><delPoint>P.O.

The changes include updated 12 digit HU boundaries derived from LiDAR source data. Each of these proposed changes were reviewed by affected stewards for validity. Subwatersheds 171002030601, 171002030602, and 171003080106 were delineated using 10 foot, and 3 foot contour layers that were derived from a LiDAR DEM. This LiDAR based DEM highlighted several areas where the WBD did not accurately reflect the condition on the ground. In most instances the boundary just needed to be moved to the ridge tops. This did not affect the overall size or the outlet of the subwatershed. However, in subwatershed 171003080106 the LiDAR source data did highlight that the outlet needed to be changed. This change affected two adjacent subwatersheds 171003080105 and 171003080107. The changes to the outlets were reviewed and accepted by the state stewards. In all but 171002030601, the adjoining subwatersheds were affected by this update. Subwateshed 71002030601 was updated in the last Oregon submittal and not all of the adjoining subwatershed's arcs needed to be updated. Updates to the WBD boundaries for these subwatersheds were performed using the ESRI Modify Edge Tool in ArcMAP 10.0 on the ArcGIS 9.2 geodatabase.</stepDesc><stepDateTm>2011-12-05</stepDateTm><stepProc><rpIndName>Bryant Mecklem</rpIndName><rpOrgName>BLM OR/WA</rpOrgName><rpPosName>GIS Specialist</rpPosName><rpCntInfo><cntPhone><voiceNum>(503) 808-6506</voiceNum></cntPhone><cntAddress><eMailAdd>bmecklem@or.blm.gov</eMailAdd></cntAddress></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="009"/></role></stepProc></prcStep><prcStep><stepDesc>The final datasets returned from USGS were assembled to make the PNW distribution coverage and the final Oregon dataset for certification.
